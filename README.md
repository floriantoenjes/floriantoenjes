## Hi there 👋, I am Florian. 
I started coding Java in 2008 at age 16, quit school at 17, and got into web techs with 20. After doing a Java Web Development Techdegree in 2016 and a Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree in 2017 on the Team Treehouse learning platform I was able to get into the industry. Since then I have worked in a variety of areas and companies while continuing to learn in my free time.

## More about me

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a What's App clone written in TypeScript with React and NestJS which I updated to run scalable on a Kubernetes cluster.
