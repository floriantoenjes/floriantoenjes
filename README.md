## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I am Florian. 
I started coding Java in 2008 at age 16, quit school at 17, and got into web techs with 20. After doing a Java Web Development Techdegree in 2016 and a Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree in 2017 on the Team Treehouse learning platform I was able to get into the industry. Since then I have worked in a variety of areas for different companies and I never stopped learning in my free time.

## More about me

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a What's App clone written in TypeScript with React and NestJS, I might switch soon though as I am starting to find that there's not much new for me to learn and grow there.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on interesting open source projects in my free time. Just opened my first PR for the NestJS framework.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about: How to get started in the software industry without a highschool diploma but having a bunch of passion.
